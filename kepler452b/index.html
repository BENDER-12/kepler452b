            <h1>What is kepler452b</h1>
            <p>Kepler-452b is an exoplanet that garnered worldwide attention as a possible "Earth cousin" 
                when it was discovered by NASA’s Kepler space telescope in 2015.
             Situated about 1,400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, Kepler-452b orbits a star remarkably similar to our Sun,
              providing intriguing possibilities for scientists investigating the potential for life and the nature of distant, Earth-like worlds.</p>

                    <h5>What So Great about Kepler?</h5>
                    <h4>Kepler-452b is located in the "habitable zone" of its star, where temperatures might allow for liquid water on its surface—a key condition for life as we know it.</h4>
                    <p>he length of a year on Kepler-452b (the time it takes to orbit its star) is about 385 Earth days, which is quite similar to Earth's year of 365 days.</p>

                    <h4>Facts about kepler-452b</h4>
                    <p>Kepler-452b's star is older than our Sun, meaning it has more stable conditions, which could be favorable for long-term habitability. However, as its star ages and becomes hotter, it may eventually cause a greenhouse effect similar to that on Venus, making the planet less hospitable over time</p>
